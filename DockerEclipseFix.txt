To run the Cypher backend (which depends on Docker) in Eclipse IDE on macOS, launch Eclipse IDE from the Terminal in macOS
with the following command: 'open -a "Eclipse" &'. This enables Eclipse to have access to the path and system variables
(e.g. "/usr/bin/local/docker" as returned by "docker"). Currently there is no fix for this issue other than what is specified
in this document. Link below is the source of this fix (user with solution is "matt broekhuis"). The solution is pasted below:

/*****************************/

I opened from macOS terminal like this.
open -a "IntelliJ IDEA" &

Then you get all the path variables in Intellij. My build worked fine then.

You will then have to open intellij this way every time. Perhaps there's a way to get a shortcut in the dock to run this command, but I've not done that research yet
