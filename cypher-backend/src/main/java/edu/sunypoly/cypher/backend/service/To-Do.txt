1. Consolidate and standardize error reporting in the "DockerSandbox" class (exceptions or return types)
2. Provide a method for gracefully stopping running Docker containers with the name "[LANG]-cypher"
	-Also to remove stopped containers and parent images
3. Add "<System(Cypher)>" tag to the error messages generated by the "DockerSandbox" class
4. Provide error handling in "DockerSandbox" class if expected containers (e.g. "gcc-cypher") are not running
	-Simply throw an error
	-Attempt to start up any stopped containers with the same name, or start containers from images
		-Perhaps instantiate a "DockerStart" class for this?
5. Enforce a timeout feature for each submission wherein if execution takes longer than "X" units of time,
   return a runtime error message (e.g., "Execution timed out")
6. Add "System.err.println(e.toString())" in "DockerStart" class
